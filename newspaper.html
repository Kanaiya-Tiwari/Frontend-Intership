            Delhi Police on Monday used water cannon at Bharatiya Janata Party
            (BJP) workers who were protesting outside Delh chief minister Arvind
            Kejriwal's residence against the violence in the Municipal
            Corporation of Delhi (MCD) House on January 6, leading<br />
            to alleged assaulting of two women BJP councillors. Demanding
            suspension of councillors involved in creating ruckus, BJP MP<br />
            Parvesh Verma said women councillors have not been assaulted before.
            Similarly, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) also held a counter-protest<br />
            against BJP in the national capital, alleging the right-wing party
            of rigging the mayoral poll. Read| Ball now in Delhi LG’s court

            CM Kejriwal earlier accused Lieutenant Governor VK Saxena of
            “illegally” encroaching upon the rights of the elected government by
            “misusing” the bureaucracy. He also said that letting nominated
            councillors to vote in the polls is “unconstitutional”. Shelly
            Oberoi and Aaley Mohammed Iqbal are the AAP candidates for the post
            of MCD mayor and deputy mayor. Whereas, Rekha Gupta and Kamal Bagdi
            are the BJP's candidates for the two respective posts.
